//! Text from other people, made safe to show and copy.

/// Characters left out of text from YouTube:
/// - control characters other than line breaks and tabs. The screen drops
///   them anyway, but copied text keeps them, and a hidden `\r` or escape
///   can run a command when pasted into a shell or vim.
/// - bidi overrides and isolates, which can make text read backwards:
///   "invoice<U+202E>fdp.exe" shows as `invoiceexe.pdf` in some terminals,
///   and the bidi marks.
/// - invisible characters that terminals and the layout disagree on: the
///   layout counts them as no columns, while some terminals move the cursor
///   on, which pushes the rest of the row out of place. These are the Hangul
///   fillers of "invisible" names, the soft hyphen, zero-width
///   spaces and the like. Joiners and variation selectors stay, since emoji
///   need them.
/// - the line and paragraph separators (U+2028, U+2029): not control
///   characters, but a terminal that breaks a line on them would push the
///   rest of a message body out of the bubble the layout drew for it.
/// - the private character kitty uses to place images, so text can't pose
///   as one.
